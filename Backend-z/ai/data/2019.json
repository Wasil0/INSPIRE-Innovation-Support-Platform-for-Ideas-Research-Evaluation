    "description": "In today's dynamic cybersecurity environment, organizations face increasing threats, a shortage of skilled security professionals, and delayed response times due to manual processes. To address these challenges, the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform has been developed. Integrated with the Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, SOAR automates security workflows using Ansible playbooks, enabling rapid and consistent incident response. The platform features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating custom workflows and a comprehensive dashboard displaying security event summaries and actionable insights. By reducing response time from hours or minutes to seconds, SOAR allows security teams to focus on critical tasks while improving operational efficiency. Overall, the platform provides a cost-effective, time-efficient, and robust solution, enhancing organizations' ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats effectively.",

    "team_members": ["Hamza Junaid", "Mohsin Iqbal", "Mehdi Zafar"],
    "description": "Fractional ownership of real estate is an innovative investment model that enables individuals to own a portion of a property rather than purchasing it outright, reducing the need for large capital investments. This approach is gaining popularity due to its flexibility and accessibility for small and medium investors. Blockchain technology enhances fractional ownership by enabling property shares to be represented as digital tokens that can be securely bought, sold, and traded on a decentralized platform. These blockchain-based transactions ensure transparency, immutability, and security, significantly reducing the risk of fraud. Additionally, tokenization improves liquidity by allowing investors to trade their ownership shares easily while also earning rental income. Overall, integrating blockchain technology with fractional real estate ownership simplifies the investment process, increases market participation, and has the potential to transform the traditional real estate industry by making it more transparent, efficient, and inclusive.",

    "team_members": ["Muhammad Hamza", "Muhtashim Malick", "Muhammad Ebadullah", "Syed Muhammad Shayan"],
    "description": "An external cyber-attack surface consists of all publicly exposed IT assets of an organization, such as domains, subdomains, DNS servers, and email services, which can be accessed by both legitimate users and malicious attackers. These assets are continuously targeted by threat actors seeking vulnerabilities, especially through advanced social-engineering and domain-spoofing techniques. As modern attack surfaces extend beyond internal networks to include third-party managed assets, organizations require continuous visibility and monitoring of their external digital footprint. Attack Eye addresses this challenge by providing an outside-in view of an organization's cyber-attack surface through automated subdomain enumeration and asset mapping. The platform enables organizations to maintain updated asset inventories, identify exposure points, and prioritize risk mitigation, making it a critical component of an effective cybersecurity risk management strategy.",

    "description": "This project develops a deep learning-based application to locate missing children in Pakistan, addressing the country's high rates of child abduction and abuse. Users can file missing person reports using images or videos, which are enhanced and processed by the system. Uploaded images or videos of found children are automatically compared with existing records, and guardians are notified with location and relevant details when matches are found. The system collects data from schools, colleges, and online sources, employing optimized models selected for accuracy. By providing a fast, efficient, and centralized platform, this application supports law enforcement agencies in conducting timely investigations, accelerates reporting, and enhances the chances of safely recovering missing children.",

    "team_members": ["Mubina Waheed", "Samra Saleem", "Ali Hamza Detho", "Samar ul Hassan Zaidi"],
    "description": "This project develops an end-to-end UEBA system to detect malicious users and insider threats using advanced analytics, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional SIEM solutions, UEBA relies on probabilistic models and risk factors rather than Boolean alerts. The system processes the Carnegie Mellon University insider threat dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, feature extraction---including sentiment and quantitative analysis---and model training. Fourteen features are extracted per user to identify behavioral patterns. A deep learning Autoencoder generates a baseline of routine activity, enabling the detection of anomalies. The system achieves 83% accuracy and 71% recall, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing malicious behavior from normal actions and providing a robust cybersecurity solution for insider threat mitigation.",

    "description": "This project develops a machine learning model to predict noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in diabetic patients, enhancing early risk assessment and healthcare intervention. Using a comprehensive dataset containing medical attributes such as heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain, age, and gender, the system evaluates patients' likelihood of developing NCDs. Multiple machine learning algorithms---including K-Nearest Neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines---are explored to identify the most accurate predictive model. The output provides risk scores to guide healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and developing personalized preventive strategies. By combining data-driven insights with medical expertise, this system improves patient outcomes, supports proactive disease management, and contributes to enhanced quality of life.",
