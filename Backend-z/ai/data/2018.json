An offline, smartphone-based device is developed, integrated with an AI model capable of detecting DR stages without requiring internet connectivity. The device leverages the smartphone camera and a portable Vista View camera to capture retinal images, which are pre-processed, cleaned, and augmented to reduce dataset bias. The dataset is divided for training and testing to develop an accurate AI model for DR detection. A mobile application is created to interface with the device, providing an accessible and cost-effective solution for early detection of DR. This approach ensures timely diagnosis, reduces dependence on specialists, and improves healthcare access in underserved areas.",

    "title": "Offensive Speech Detection in Urdu using Automated Speech Recognition System",
    "team_members": ["Yamna Tahir", "Syeda Hamna Javed", "Yusra Fatima", "Amber Asad"],
    "description": "This project focuses on developing an end-to-end offensive speech detection system for Urdu using Automated Speech Recognition (ASR). Building on the historical evolution of ASR---from early systems like Audrey and IBM Shoebox to modern deep learning approaches---the system maps speech directly to text using neural networks. Audio data was collected manually, pre-processed, and fed into a deep speech model for transcription in Urdu. Natural Language Processing models, including fine-tuned MBERT, were applied to classify the intent and detect offensive content. The developed ASR achieved a word error rate of 40% and character error rate of 28.57%, while MBERT achieved 87% validation accuracy. The system outputs a transcript in Roman Urdu and identifies potentially harmful speech for enhanced content moderation.",

    "team_members": ["Huzaifa Ahmed", "Uneeb Hassan", "Syed Muhammad Umer"],
    "description": "This project focuses on developing an autonomous Mars rover to improve the efficiency and reliability of planetary exploration. Unlike past rovers, which required manual control from Earth and faced data loss due to transmission delays, the autonomous rover can navigate and perform tasks independently. The rover integrates ten major components, including an Autonomous Driving Model, Rock Analysis Model, sensors, actuators, imaging devices, and data management systems. By enabling self-directed movement and data collection, the rover can explore Martian terrains, analyze rocks, and gather scientific information with minimal human intervention. This autonomy reduces communication delays, mitigates the risk of data loss, and allows continuous exploration in harsh Martian conditions. The project aims to enhance planetary research, improve sample collection efficiency, and pave the way for future Mars missions with intelligent, self-operating robotic explorers.",

    "team_members": ["Sheikh Ishaq Kamran", "Muhammad Umar Naeem", "Syeda Fatima Kazmi", "Muhammad Kamil Jaffer"],
    "description": "This project focuses on creating a Metaverse-based virtual conference room where users can communicate through 3D avatars without relying on webcams. Each attendee is represented by a customizable avatar capable of performing gestures and interacting naturally within the virtual space. 3D models are created using Blender, while the user interface is designed in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and imported into Unity3D. Networking and multi-user interaction are implemented via Photon Unity Networking (PUN), and the application is tested using Oculus Quest VR headsets to ensure immersive and smooth functionality.The system aims to provide an interactive and realistic virtual environment, enabling users to attend meetings, collaborate, and socialize in a manner that mirrors real-life interactions. By bridging virtual identity with personal expression, this platform enhances engagement and communication, offering a sustainable and entertaining alternative to traditional video conferencing. It represents a step toward the broader adoption of immersive Metaverse experiences for professional, social, and recreational purposes.",

    "description": "This project focuses on automating sentiment analysis of textual data using machine learning to overcome human limitations in processing large volumes of text quickly. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system extracts sentiments such as joy, anger, and sadness from social media content. A Twitter web scraper is used to collect real-time data, which is then analyzed using three machine learning techniques: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The processed results are compiled into comprehensive reports, providing valuable insights and visualizations for users and administrators. Additionally, the system includes a website interface where admins can train and test models using newly acquired data, ensuring continuous improvement. This approach significantly saves time, enhances efficiency, and enables large-scale sentiment analysis in real time.",

    "description": "This project proposes a cloud-based, IoT-powered smart hospital information management system aimed at enhancing healthcare services in Pakistan. By providing unique IDs for patients and doctors, the system streamlines appointments, medical history tracking, pathology and radiology referrals, room assignments, and pharmacy management. The workflow is organized across nine modules, including Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacy, Pathology, Radiology, Receptionist, and IoT hardware integration. Developed using the Waterfall model, the system emphasizes automation to improve patient care, reduce readmission times, and facilitate medicine delivery and home health monitoring. While IoT does not replace healthcare professionals, it supports them by providing real-time data, improving diagnosis, treatment efficiency, and overall patient outcomes in a user-friendly and accessible manner.",
