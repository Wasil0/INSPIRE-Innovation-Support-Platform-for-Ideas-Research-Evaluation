    "description": "This project addresses the need for efficient techniques for sustainable agricultural practices and daily crop monitoring. The primary goal is to classify crops using satellite view. The methodology involved: The images (S2L1C) were downloaded from the Sentinel Hub. The images were preprocessed and analyzed using a time-series approach with data based on Landsat. Multiple classification methods were tested, and the average accuracy of classification exceeded 80%. This approach to field monitoring and crop identification helps predict the overall yield of a particular crop and could reduce the time and money spent on traditional land surveys.",
